            <article>
                <p>
                    We see a variety of objects, living or non-living in our life. 
                    They are of different shapes, colours and sizes. 
                    But, all of them are made up of matter.
                    Anything that has mass, occupies space and can be perceived by our senses is called matter.
                    Thus, the air we breathe, the water we drink and the chair we sit are also made of matter.
                    But, not everything is matter: time, sound, light, energy, gravity, heat, etc... are not matter.
                    Therefore, we can distinguish matter into three types.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Solid</li>
                        <li>Liquid</li>
                        <li>Gas</li>
                    </ol>

                <p>            
                    There are also changes around us, Boiling water evaporating, hot shower water turning to steam, etc... are some examples. Therefore, we can distinguish changes into four types:
                <ol>
                    <li>Reversible Change</li>
                    <li>Irreversible Change</li>
                    <li>Physical Change</li>
                    <li>Chemical Change</li>
                </ol>
                    We will explore these types of matter and changes in greater detail in the following pages.

        <h1><span>Composition of Matter</span></h1>

                <h2><span>Atom</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. 
                    They are basic building blocks of any substance. 
                    Everything around us is made up of atoms.
                </p>
                <h2><span>Properties of an Atom</span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>An atom is the smallest unit that has the characteristic properties of a substance.</li>
                    <li>It cannot be seen by unaided eyes or even with a standard microscope.</li>
                    <li>In solids, atoms are tightly packed together. In liquids, they are loosely packed. In gases, there is a lot of space between them.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2><span>Structure of an Atom</span></h2>
                <p>
                    An atom is made up of even smaller particles which are called subatomic particles. 
                    They are protons, neutrons and electrons. 
                    The centre of an atom is called nucleus. 
                    It consists of protons and neutrons. 
                    The outer part consists of electrons, that keep on revolving around the nucleus in a circular orbit.

                    Protons are positively charged. 
                    Neutrons are about the size of protons but have no charge.
                    Electrons, much smaller than protons or neutrons, are negatively charged.
                    Electrons has a negligible mass, its actual mass is 9.1 x 10<sup>-31</sup> kg.
                    Different atoms have different number of subatomic particles. 
                    An atom is electrically neutral because it has equal number of protons and electrons.

                    An atom can lose, gain or share its electrons. 
                    An ion is a charged particle formed from an atom by the loss or gain of electrons.

                <p>
                    A molecule is the smallest unit of matter, which can exist independently. 
                    A molecule is a group of two or more atoms that are chemically combined.
                    In a molecule atoms combine in two ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Two or more atoms of same element combine together for example, a molecule of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas consists of two hydrogen atoms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Two or more atoms of different elements combine together for example, a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) gas consists of one carbon and two oxygen atoms.

        <h1><span>Classification of Matter</span></h1>
        <section>
            <p>
                Matter can be classified as pure substances and mixtures. 
                Pure substances are further classified as elements and compounds. 
                Mixtures are classified into homogeneous and heterogenous mixtures.

                <h2><span>Elements</span></h2>
                <p>
                    An element is a pure substance. 
                    It consists of only one type of atoms. 
                    For example, the element oxygen is composed of only oxygen atoms.
                    Atoms of one element are not identical to atoms of another element.
                    e.g., the atoms of iron are different from those of gold. 
                    Therefore, there are as many types of atoms as there are elements. 

                    At present, there are 118 known elements. 
                    List of the elements is represented in a periodic table.
                    Hydrogen, oxygen, copper, iron, sulphur, magnesium and gold are some examples of elements. 
                    Chemists use chemical symbols to represent elements. 
                    A molecule of an element consists of two or more same atoms such as molecule of nitrogen gas will have only nitrogen atoms.

                <h2><span>Compounds</span></h2>
                <p>
                    A compound is a pure substance formed when two or more elements chemically combine in a definite ratio.
                    The properties of a compound are different from the properties of the constituent elements. 
                    For example, water (liquid) is a compound made up of two completely different gaseous elements, hydrogen and oxygen. 
                    The properties of water are entirely different from those of hydrogen and oxygen. 
                    Different elements can combine with one another to form millions of compounds. 
                    A molecule of the compound consists of two or more different atoms.
                </p>
                <h2><span>Properties of Compound</span></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        A compound is made up of the same combination of elements combined in a fixed proportion by mass irrespective of the source it is obtained. 
                        For example, all samples of water for example rain water, tap water or sea water contain two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The properties of a compound are entirely different from those of its constituent elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The constituent elements of a compound cannot be separated by simple physical methods such as evaporation and filtration.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2><span>Mixtures</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Mixtures are substances in which two or more substances are physically mixed together in any proportion. 
                    Air is made up of gases such as oxygen and nitrogen mixed together. 
                    The constituents in a mixture can be separated by simple physical methods. 
                    The constituents in a mixture are not present in any fixed proportions
                    The individual properties of all the constituents of a mixture are retained. 
                    For example, a salad is a mixture. 
                    The constituent vegetables do not combine chemically and can be separated easily.
                    It is divided into two categories:

                <p>
                    Homogeneous mixtures are those in which the components are uniformly distributed throughout the mixture.
                    In other words, “they are uniform throughout”.
                    Homogeneous mixtures are also called solutions.
                    Examples of homogeneous mixtures include air, sugar water, rainwater, ect....

                <p>
                    This type of mixture consists of components that are not completely mixed.
                    Particles are distributed non-uniformly within this type of mixture.
                    You can visually identify a heterogeneous mixture.
                    Heterogeneous mixtures have a non-uniform composition.
                    Examples of heterogeneous mixtures include seawater, pizza, etc....

        <p style="padding-inline: 100px;">
            States of matter refer to the different physical forms that matter can exist in based on factors like temperature and pressure. 
            There are 3 primary states of matter:

            Phase changes, also known as phase transitions, are fundamental processes in the study of matter.
            They refer to the transformations that substances undergo when changing from one physical state (solid, liquid, gas) to another due to changes in temperature and pressure. 
            These phase transitions are vital in understanding how matter behaves and are encountered in numerous aspects of daily life, as well as in various scientific and industrial applications. 
            Here's the list of phase changes:

            A chemical change is known as a chemical reaction. The substance involved in the reaction are known as reactants, and the new substances formed during the reaction are known as products. Energy change is one of the characteristics of a chemical change, because of the formation of the new product. A chemical reaction is represented by a chemical equation.

                In some reactions, a chemical change is indicated by a change in colour. 
                The cut surface of a half-eaten apple, it kept for a while, turns brown. 
                This is because of a chemical reaction that takes place between air and the chemicals on the cut surface of the apple called oxidation. This forms melanin. 
                Also rusting of iron is a chemical reation that changes colour.
                It is represented by the following chemical reaction.

                Sometimes when two clear solutions combine, an insoluble solid is formed that settles down as a precipitate. 
                The formation of the precipitate indicates that a chemical change has occurred.

                <h2>Generation of Light and Sound</h2>
                Explosion of a firecrackers is a chemical change that produces light, sound and heat with oxygen.
                It is a combustion reaction beacause it is a reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen, releasing energy in the form of light and heat.

                Many chemical changes give off distinctive smell. 
                A spoiled food produces a distinct odour as it undergoes a chemical change. 
                A rotten egg smells different from a fresh egg. 
                Curd smells different from the milk.

                <h2>Absorption or Release of Heat</h2>
                <section style="padding: 0;">
                <article>
                Almost all chemical reactions are accompanied with either absorption or release of heat. 
                When a cake is baked, heat is absorbed which changes the runny batter into a solid cake. 
                Chemical reactions where heat is absorbed by the substances are known seen endothermic reactions. 
                Evaporation of water is endothermic as heat is absorbed to convert water into water vapour.

                Firecrackers, when ignited, release energy in the form of heat and light.
                Such reactions in which heat energy is released are called exothermic reactions.
                Burning of substance is exothermic as it is accompanied by production of heat.

                        Unlike pure substances, components of mixtures are usually easy to separate into their different parts. 
                        For example, a few small iron nails have been dropped into a sandpit and have sunk into the sand so that they can't be seen.
                        Spread the mixture on a sheet and bring the magnet near the mixture. 
                        The nails are attracted to the magnet and sand is left behind. The nails and sand have different characteristic properties. 
                        What if plastic beads had been dropped into the sandpit instead of nails? 
                        They can't be separated from the sand with a magnet. 
                        The key to separate components of mixtures is recognising the different properties of the components.
                        <br>
                        Components of mixtures are separated for the following purposes:

                        <li>
                            To remove impurities or harmful components: For example, rice or pulses may contain small stones or other solid impurities, which are harmful if consumed. 
                            These impurities are removed to make the food safe for consumption. 
                            River water is purified to make it fit for drinking before supplying the water to our homes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To obtain useful components: Crude oil (petroleum) is a mixture of various substances. 
                            It is distilled to obtain various useful components such as petrol, kerosene, diesel and white petroleum jelly. Similarly, butter can be obtained from milk or curd by churning it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To obtain pure components: Pure metals are separated from their natural mixed forms called ores.

                        Separation of a mixture essentially means the removal of one substance from a mixture of two or more substances. 
                        We have to use such a property that one component of the mixture has and the others do not. 
                        You can easily separate a packet of assorted candies of different flavours into individual flavours by handpicking them. 
                        However, separation by handpicking becomes difficult when the components are tiny and in large quantities. 
                        Sometimes, they may not even be visible to naked eyes.

                        <p>
                            Hand-picking involves picking out substances by hand and separating them from others. 
                            It is used when the components to be separated are large and easily distinguishable, unwanted materials are present in small quantities, and the shape, size and colour of the unwanted materials are different from those of the useful materials.
                            For example, small stones, broken grains and husk are separated from rice, wheat and pulses by hand-picking.

                        <p>
                            Threshing is the process of separating grain from the harvested stalks.
                            After harvesting the wheat and rice crops, the grains are separated from the stalks. 
                            This is done by threshing. 
                            It can be done by manually beating the dry stalks on the ground or a hard surface to shake off the dried grains, trampling them under the feet of animals like bullocks or using threshing machines.

                        <p>
                            Winnowing is used for separating grains from husk. 
                            Farmers drop the mixture of grains and husk from a height. 
                            The husk is carried by the wind and forms a heap at a small distance away. 
                            The wheat grains being heavier fall almost vertically to form a separate heap.
                            In this method wind is used to separate heavier particles (sand) from the lighter particles (powdered dry leaves).

                        <p>
                            Sieving is used for separating components of a mixture on the basis of their particle size. 
                            A sieve is usually made of a woven screen such as a mesh or a net. The size of the pores in the sieve depends on the size of the particles of the constituent to be separated.
                            Pores in a sieve allow the smaller components of the mixture to pass through and retain the larger ones.
                            A sieve is commonly used at home to separate bran from the wheat flour. 
                            Sieving is also used for separating gravel from sand. A sieve with bigger pores is used at construction sites to separate stones from sand.

                        <h3><span>Magnetic Separation</span></h3>
                        <p>
                            Some substances are attracted by a magnet. 
                            Such substances are called magnetic substances. 
                            In a mixture, where one of the components is magnetic in nature and the other is non-magnetic, the components can be separated using a magnet. 
                            For example, iron is magnetic while sand is non-magnetic. 
                            So, we can use a magnet to separate iron filings mixed in sand. 
                            The iron filings get attracted towards the magnet and stick to it while the sand particles are left behind.

                    Solid substances may be either soluble or insoluble in a liquid. For example, sugar is soluble in water, whereas chalk powder is not. 
                    Different methods are used for separating soluble and insoluble substances from their respective mixtures.

                        <h3><span>Separating Insoluble Solids form Liquids</span></h3>
                        <p>
                            Solids such as chalk powder, sand and dust particles are insoluble in water.
                            Particles of such solids can be separated from their solutions using one of the following methods: sedimentation and decantation, filtration, and loading.
                            <br><br>
                            <h4><span>Sedimentation and Decantation:</span></h4> 
                            This method is used for separating insoluble substances that are heavier than water. 
                            When such a mixture is left undisturbed or some time, the heavier particles settle at the bottom of the container.
                            This process of settling down of heavier, insoluble components (such as mud) in a mixture (muddy water) is called sedimentation. 
                            The particles that settle down form the sediment. 
                            The clear liquid that remains above the sediments is called supernatant. 
                            The supernatant is carefully poured out into another container without disturbing the sediment. 
                            This process of pouring out the supernatant slowly into another container such that sediments are not disturbed is known as decantation.
                            <br><br>
                            <h4><span>Loading:</span></h4> 
                            Muddy water contains some very fine particles. These fine particles either stay suspended in water or take a long time to settle down. 
                            When alum is added, which is soluble in water, can suspend the heavy particles in water. 
                            This makes the fine particles heavy, which then settle down quickly. 
                            This method which helps fine particles that remain suspended to settle down by adding alum which loads the mud particles and speeds up sedimentation.
                            <br><br>
                            <h4><span>Filtration:</span></h4>
                            Mix saw dust and salt to make a mixture.
                            Put the mixture in a beaker and add water to it.
                            Now, fold the filter paper into a cone.
                            Stir the mixture with a glass rod.
                            Pass this mixture through the cone-shaped filter paper fixed in a funnel.
                            <br>
                            The filter paper has fine pores (holes). 
                            It does not allow the sawdust pass through it. 
                            As a result, it accumulates on the filter paper. 
                            The water and the dissolved salt passes through the filter paper. 
                            It gets collected in the beaker placed below the funnel. 
                            This method of separating insoluble components from the mixture using a filter is called filtration. 
                            
                            In this method, a solution is passed through a filter.
                            The filter allows the liquid to pass through and retains the solid particles. 
                            The solid particles retained by the filter are known as the residue. 
                            The clear liquid collected alter the filtering process is called the filtrate. 
                            The filter used may be a filter paper, a fine muslin cloth, a fine mesh, unglazed earthenware or other porous materials.
                            Keep in Mind that the size of the pores in the filter should be smaller than the size of the solid particles being separated.

                            <h4><span>Evaporation:</span></h4> 
                            It is a method used to recover a dissolved solid component from a solution. 
                            In this process, the solution is heated. 
                            This causes the liquid to evaporate leaving behind the solid component. 
                            The common salt is mostly produced naturally from sea from sea water water by this method. 
                            The sea water is collected in shallow ponds. 
                            Water evaporates due to the heat of the sun and salt is left.

                            <h4><span>Condensation:</span></h4> 
                            Condensation: It is the process in which water vapour converts back to its liquid form. 
                            We can hold a steel saucepan above the heating container to get back the water that evaporates. 
                            You can see drops of water on the plate as the steam cools it condenses to form liquid water.

                            It is a method of obtaining a pure liquid from a solution. 
                            This method utilises the difference in boiling points of different components of the mixture. 
                            In this method, the mixture is heated. 
                            As temperature reaches the boiling point of the liquid, it starts evaporating. 
                            The liquid vapours are passed through a condenser. 
                            As the vapours cool, they condense to form the pure liquid.
                            The pure liquid so obtained is known as the distillate, Distilled water is also obtained by this method.

                    <h2><span>Separation of a Mixture of Two Liquids</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        Milk and water mix well with each other. Such liquids that mix well with each other are called miscible liquids.
                        On the other hand, oil and water do not mix with each other. They form two separate layers- the oil layer floats on top of the water layer.
                        The two liquids do not mix even on vigorous stirring. 
                        Such liquids that do not mix with each other are called immiscible liquids.
                        <br>
                        <h4><span>Separation of Two Immisible Liquids:</span></h4>
                        Two immiscible liquids can be separated by using a separating funnel. 
                        In this method, the mixture (for example, a mixture of oil and water) is taken in a separating funnel and left undisturbed for some time.
                        The heavier liquid (water) collects as the bottom layer and the lighter one (oil) forms the top layer. 
                        A beaker is placed below the separating funnel to collect the liquid. 
                        The stopper of the separating funnel is opened to let the bottom layer of liquid flow out. 
                        The stopper is turned off just when the top layer of liquid reaches the stopper.
                        <br>
                        <h4><span>Separation of Two Missicible Liquids:</span></h4>
                        Miscible liquids such as alcohol and water can be separated by the method of distillation. 
                        When the mixture of the miscible liquids is heated, liquid with lowest boiling point gets evaporated first.
                        Its vapours are passed through a condenser. 
                        Here, the vapours are cooled and convert into liquid form. 
                        The other liquid remains in the flask.
                        Distilled water, alcohol, petrol, diesel, gasoline, kerosene, paraffin and many other liquids are produced commercially by the same method.
