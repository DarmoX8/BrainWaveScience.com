                    All living organisms need energy to perform their day-to-day activities and to carry out various processes of their body. Energy is also required for growth, development, repair and maintenance of the body. 
                    We need energy even when we are sleeping. 
                    How do living organisms obtain this energy?
                    The food we eat is the source of energy. 
                    Inside the cells, the digested food is burnt and the energy is released. 
                    The process of burning of food to release energy requires oxygen.

                    This products such as carbon dioxide and water are released in this process. 
                    This process in which food is broken down in the presence of oxygen to release energy, carbon dioxide and water vapour is called respiration.
                    Respiration is an essential characteristic of living beings.

                            The process of taking in oxygen-rich air and giving out carbon dioxide-rich air is called breathing. 
                            It is also called external respiration. 
                            The taking in of air is called inhalation and giving out of air is called exhalation.

                            It is the process in which oxygen is used to burn food and carbon dioxide is released along with water and energy. As this process takes place within the cells of our body, it is known as cellular respiration or internal respiration. 
                            During respiration, the digested food in the form of glucose reacts with oxygen. 
                            This reaction can be represented by a given chemical equation.

                In humans, respiration takes place through a complex system of organs.
                These organs collectively make the respiratory system.

                    The parts of the human respiratory system are nostrils, nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, and lungs.

                        <p>
                            The nostrils are external openings to let the air into the nasal cavity. Air is passed from nostrils through the nasal cavity. The hair present in the nostrils acts as a filter against germs. The blood circulating through the nose warms the inhaled air. This clean substance called mucus, present in the nasal cavity, moistens the air and traps any dust particles present in the inhaled air. A slimy, moist, and warm air then passes through the nasal cavity.

                        <p>
                            Pharynx is the region after the nasal cavity that leads into the trachea.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Trachea</span></h3>
                        <p>
                            It is the common passageway of the esophagus and windpipe. It is guarded by an opening called the glottis, which gets covered by the epiglottis.
                            <br><br>
                            The trachea leads into the voice box or larynx containing vocal cords that vibrate when air passes through them. The trachea later divides into two tubes called bronchi (singular: bronchus), which enter into the lungs. Each bronchus further divides into tiny branches called bronchioles. Bronchioles terminate into tiny air sacs called alveoli (singular: alveolus), which give the appearance of a bunch of grapes. The alveoli provide a larger surface area for easy and faster exchange of gases. The walls of alveoli are very thin. Diffusion of gases takes place through these walls. Alveoli have a rich supply of blood through a dense network of capillaries present around them.

                        <p>
                            Lungs are the main respiratory organs and are located on both sides of the chest cavity. The air travels from nostrils to lungs through the nasal cavity, pharynx, and trachea. It finally reaches the lungs through bronchi. The lungs are pink in color and spongy due to the presence of air spaces and a large number of blood capillaries filled with blood. The lungs are protected in the rib cage and supported by a large flat muscle at the floor of the chest cavity called the diaphragm.

                <p>Breathing is a physical process that involves inhalation and exhalation. Before we learn about the mechanism of breathing, let us first perform a simple activity to study the functioning of the respiratory system.</p>

        <section>
            <p>
                During inhalation, the diaphragm moves downwards, and the chest cavity moves outwards, creating space for air to enter the lungs. When the diaphragm moves upwards and ribs move downward and inward, the chest cavity is reduced, and air, in turn, is pushed out. This is called exhalation. This expansion and relaxation of the lungs during breathing also cause a slight visible movement in the abdominal area.
                <br><br>
                The number of times air is inhaled or exhaled in a minute is termed breathing rate. It increases with an increase in physical activity.  The average rate of breathing in a man at rest position is 15-20 per minute.)

                <p>
                    The exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) takes place in alveoli.
                    When we inhale oxygen-rich air, the amount of oxygen present in alveoli is more than the blood present in the surrounding capiliaries. 
                    Thus, oxygen diffuse air in alveoli to the blood in capillaries. 
                    Similarly, the blood present in surrounding capillaries has more carbon dioxide than the air present in the alveoli. 
                    Thus, carbon dioxide moves from capillary blood to the air present in the alveoli.

                    The oxygen absorbed by the blood binds with haemoglobin, a protein present in the blood and forms oxyhaemoglobin. 
                    It is transported in this form to the different parts of the body. 
                    It is realesed in the cells where it is used for cellular resoiration.
                    In cellular respiration, oxygen reacts with glucose to form carbon dioxide and water. 
                    Energy is realesed in this process.
                    The carbon dioxide formed durinng respiration is carried by the blood to the lungs to be expelled out of the body during exhalation.

                In most of the organisms, oxygen is required for respiration, but some organisms such as yeast and some bacteria do not use oxygen for respiration. 
                Thus, respiration is of two types aerobic respiration (presence of air) and anaerobic respiration (absence of air).

                    The respiration which is carried out in the presence of oxygen is called aerobic respiration. 
                    In this process, glucose formed after digestion combines with the inhaled oxygen. 
                    Glucose then breaks down into carbon dioxide and water, and releases energy. 
                    This type of respiration is carried out by almost all plants and animals.

                <p>
                    The respiration which is carried out in the absence of oxygen is called anaerobic respiration. 
                    In this process, the sugar breaks down into carbon dioxide and alcohol with the production of energy. 
                    The amount of energy released here is much less as compared to aerobic respiration.
                    Several bacteria and fungi, such as yeast, can respire anaerobically. 
                    Yeast is therefore also used in wine and beer industries.

                    The chemical equation of anaerobic respiration can be represented as follows:

                <h3><span>Anaerobic Respiration in Humans</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Anaerobic respiration may also occur in the muscle cells of our arms and legs.
                    It is also called fermentation.
                    While performing a physical activity like running, the body muscles need a lot of energy for which they respire fast but do not get sufficient oxygen. 
                    In such situations, anaerobic respiration takes place in our muscle cells.
                    Under normal conditions, the muscle cells of our body respire aerobically.
                    They are not always respiring anaerobically. 
                    It is only under special conditions when oxygen is lacking that our muscles start respiring anaerobically.
                    But here, instead of alcohol, lactic acid is produced (CO, is not produced), which accumulates in the muscles. 
                    This is the reason why we get cramps. 
                    As and when the lactic acid breaks down slowly, we start to feel comfortable again.

                    There are some organisms that respire through their body surface, for example, Amoeba, Euglena, and Paramecium. 
                    They take oxygen directly from the surroundings. Oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse in and out through the outer cell membrane or the body surface.
                    In earthworm and leech, the skin is moist and helps in the exchange of gases. Gaseous exchange through the skin is also known as cutaneous respiration.

                    Fishes and other aquatic organisms take in the oxygen dissolved in water and give out carbon dioxide directly in water. 
                    To do so, they have special organs for respiration called gills. 
                    Gills are covered by the operculum. 
                    Numerous thin filaments are present inside gills.
                    These filaments are surrounded by a dense network of capillaries around them.
                    Exchange of gases takes place through these capillaries. 
                    Operculum allows water to enter and pass over the gills to give oxygen and receive carbon dioxide.
                    Finally, the water passes out from the operculum.

                    Birds breathe with the help of lungs present in their chest cavity. 
                    They have air-filled sacs near the lungs. 
                    The air sacs make the body of birds lighter, which help them to fly. Mammals also have highly developed lungs for gaseous exchange.
                    <br><br>
                    Amphibians such as frogs and toads have a dual system of frog mode of breathing. 
                    They have a soft and moist skin, which is supplied with blood capillaries. 
                    When hibernating, frogs take oxygen through their skin by diffusion.
                    Frogs breathe through gills when they are tadpoles, but as they mature, they develop lungs. 
                    Frogs respire through lungs on land.

                    Plants are also living organisms that carry out various life processes such as growth, transportation of materials and photosynthesis for which they need energy. 
                    To obtain energy, plants also respire. 
                    Each part of plant respires individually. 
                    The stomata (singular: stoma), which help in photosynthesis, also help in the respiration process. 
                    The stomata consist of two bean-shaped cells called guard cells, which allow the opening and closing of the stomatal pore to take in oxygen.
                    Woody stems have small openings on their bark called lenticels for breathing.
                    Roots of plants also breathe with the help of root hair. 
                    Farmers turn the soil and in the soil particles by diffusion.

                    All living organisms need food to sustain. 
                    The process of intake of food and its proper utilisation in the body is termed as nutrition.
                    Components of food such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals are called nutrients. 
                    Living organisms broadly exhibit two modes of nutrition- autotrophic (auto = self; trophic = to feed) and heterotrophic (hetero = another; trophic = to feed).

                    The green plants are autotrophs as they prepare their own food using carbon dioxide, sunlight, water and minerals. 
                    They are also called producers as they produce

                The process by which plants prepere their own food is called photosynthesis. 
                It is the proces by which plants produce glucose by utilising carbon dioxide, water, sunlight (solor energy).
                <br>
                The leaves of plants contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. 
                This pigment imparts green colour to the plants and traps the solar energy. 
                Plants take in carbon dioxide from the surrounding air. 
                Water and minerals are absorbed by the roots and transported to the site of photosynthesis. 
                Leaves are the main site of photosynthesis in plants.

                Plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.
                This oxygen is released into the air.
                The glucose is stored in the form of starch in leaves and in other parts of the plant.
                Goth glucose and starch are forms of carbohydrate.
                The presence of starch in a leaf verifies the occurrence of photosynthesis.

                    This nitrogen is obtained by plants from the soil. 
                    The nitrogen present in the air cannot be used as such by plants. 
                    There are some bacteria present in the soil that convert this gaseous nitrogen into a form that can be easily absorbed and utilised by plants.
                    Such bacteria are called nitrogen-fixing bacteria, for example, Rhizobium.

                    Some living organisms depend on other living organisms for food. 
                    These organisms have heterotrophic mode of nutrition and are called heterotrophs. 
                    All animals including humans and the plants that cannot carry out photosynthesis are heterotrophs. 
                    Monotropa and Cuscuta are examples of heterotrophic plants. 
                    Let us study different types of heterotrophic plants.

                <h2><span>Parasitic Plants</span></h2>
                <p>
                    These heterotrophic plants have parasitic mode of nutrition. 
                    In this mode of nutrition, a plant lives on another living plant and derives its nutrition from the latter. 
                    The plant that derives nutrition, is called a parasite. 
                    The plant from which the parasite derives its nutrition is called a host.

                    Some examples of parasitic plants are Cuscuta (or dodder) and Rafflesia.
                    Cuscuta is a pale yellow twining plant often seen on tree tops. 
                    It twins over the host and absorbs its nutrients using certain special roots. 
                    Rafflesia is a parasitic plant found in the forests of Malaysia. 
                    It has the biggest and the heaviest flower.
                    There are certain plants that are partial parasites, for example Mistletoe.
                    These plants can prepare their own food but depend on other plants
                    or host for water and minerals.

                <p>
                    These plants feed on insects by trapping and digesting them. 
                    Some examples of insectivorous plants are pitcher plant, Venus fly trap, sundew and bladderwort. 
                    Most of these plants are found in the environment where nitrogen is not readily available. 
                    They use insect protein as a source of nitrogen. This
                    is a kind of holozoic nutrition.
                    
                    Insectivorous plants can photosynthesise. 
                    Yet, they feed on insects to fulfill their requirement of nitrogen. 
                    They synthesise carbohydrates through photosynthesis only.

                    <br><br>
                    The leaves of a pitcher plant are modified into a pitcher-like structure. 
                    The tip of the leaf forms a lid to the pitcher. 
                    The insect trapped in the pitcher plant is directed down by the hair in the pitcher. 
                    There the insect is digested by the enzymes present in the juices inside the pitcher.

                <p>
                    Some plants derive nutrition from dead and decaying organic matter (dead plants and animals). 
                    Such plants are called saprophytes and this mode of nutrition is called saprophytic. 
                    Examples of saprophytes are Monotropa, mushrooms and bread moulds. 
                    The saprophytes release digestive juices on the dead and decaying matter. 
                    These juices act upon and convert organic matter into liquid form (simpler substances). 
                    These organisms then again absorb this liquid and obtain nutrition from it.

                <p>
                    Symbiotic relationship is a close association of two different organisms. 
                    In this association, two organisms may mutually benefit from each other. 
                    They actually get nourishment from each other. 
                    An example of such a relationship is lichen, which is an association between algae and fungi. 
                    Algae, being an autotroph, synthesise food. 
                    Fungi, being saprophytic, absorb water and minerals and supply to the algal partner along with the shelter.

                <h3><span>Symbiotic association helps to replenish the soil</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Symbiotic association is extremely helpful to the farmers. 
                    Soil provides many minerals to the plant (such as phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen). 
                    Among all the nutrients, nitrogen is very important for the growth of the plant as well as for the synthesis of proteins. 
                    Plants cannot utilise the atmospheric nitrogen. 
                    Certain microbes such as Rhizobium can convert atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be easily used by plants. 
                    This bacterium gets associated with the roots of leguminous plants such as peas, beans and gram. 
                    The plant, provides food and shelter to the bacterium. 
                    Rhizobium fixes nitrogen for the plant and thus helps in replenishing the nutrient in the soil. 
                    That is why, farmers grow a leguminous crop in between two main crops to maintain the fertility of the soil.

        <h1><span>DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</span></h1>
        <section id="list">
            <article>
                <p>
                    The human digestive system is a complex series of organs and structures that work together to break down food and absorb nutrients. It is also known as alimentary canal or the digestive tract. It consists of several main parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <img src="Images/Content/Digestive Tract.jpg" alt="Digestive System" style="float: right; margin: 30px;">
                    <li><h3><span>Mouth:</span></h3> The digestive process begins in the mouth, where teeth mechanically break down food, and salivary glands release enzymes to start the chemical digestion of carbohydrates.</li>

                    <li><h3><span>Esophagus/Food Pipe:</span></h3> The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. After chewing and swallowing, food travels down the esophagus to the stomach, this process is called peristalis. No digestion takes place.</li>

                    <li><h3><span>Stomach:</span></h3> The stomach is a J-shaped, thick-walled, bag-like structure. The stomach is the widest part of the digestive system. It stores food and digests it by secreting gastric juices and by muscular churning. The gastric juices include hydrochloric acid and enzymes. These enzymes break down the proteins present in the food into simpler substances. The acid kills any bacteria that come along the food. The stomach has an inner lining called mucosa, which protects the stomach from the acidic effect of hydrochloric acid. The food gets partially digested in the stomach. The final disgestion of food takes place in the small intestine.</li>
                    
                    <li><h3><span>Small intestine</span></h3> In small intestine, distion of food gets completed. It is the longest part of the alimentary canal and arranged in coils. It is tabular in shape and has three main parts - duodenum, jejunum and ileum.
                    The small intestive contains villi richly supplied with blood vessels for absortion of nutrients to the blood.
                    The semi-digested food (chyme) received from the stomach gets digested in small intestine with the help of digestive juices secreted by liver and pancreas.
                    <br><br>
                    Liver is a gland present on the right side of the upper abdomen. It is reddish-brown in colour. and secretes bile juice. It is the largest gland in the body. Bile juice seceted from the liver is stored in a sac called gall bladder. Bile juice breaks down large fat into smaller fat. This process is called emulsification. The digestive juices then further break these particles into fatty acids and glycerol.
                    <br><br>
                    Pancreas is a glad located below the stomach. It secretes pancreatic juice and releases it into the small intestine. The enzymes present in the pancreatic juice break down starch into simple sugars (glucose) and proteins into simpler compounds called amino acids. Digestion is compled in the digestive tract.
                    </li>
                    <li><h3><span>Large intestine:</span></h3> The undigested food from the small intestine goes to the large intestine. Water is absorbed from this. Then the undigested food goes in to the rectum where it is stored then the anus. This process is called egestion.</li>

            <article>
                The circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system, is a vital organ system in the human body responsible for the transportation of blood. It consists of the heart, blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries), and blood.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Blood:</span></h3> Blood is a red-coloured liquid which circulates through the circulatory system. There are two main components of blood: blood plasma (fluid) and blood cells (solid). 
                        <br><br>
                        Blood Plasma is a colourless liquid consisting of 90% water, 10% minerals, dissolved food, some proteins and waste products. It caries these from one part to another part of the body.
                        <br><br>
                        Blood Cells are of three types: Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells and Platelets. Red Blood Cells (RBCs) contain haemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen, allowing RBCs to transport oxygen from the lungs to body tissues. It is produced in the bone marrow. White Blood Cells (WBCs) fight diseases and infection, therefore increase in numbers when the person is ill. It is a crucial part of the immune system and play a crucial role in defending the body against infections and foreign invaders. It can eat up germs. Platelets help in blood clotting. Because of Platelets, blood stops coming after a few minutes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h3><span>Blood Vessels:</span></h3> Blood vessels are a complex network of tubes that transport blood throughout the body. They include:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Arteries: These blood vessels carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the various parts of the body.</li>

                            <li>Veins: Veins transport deoxygenated blood from the body's tissues back to the heart.</li>

                            <li>Capillaries: Capillaries are tiny, thin-walled vessels that connect arteries and veins, facilitating the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and body cells.</li>

                        <h3><span>Heart:</span></h3> The heart is a muscular organ located in the chest, slightly to the left. It serves as the central pump of the circulatory system. The heart contracts rhythmically to pump oxygenated blood to the body's cells and receive deoxygenated blood from the body to be oxygenated again in the lungs.

                The excretory system, also known as the urinary system, is responsible for removing waste and excess materials from the human body, maintaining the body's internal balance, and regulating various physiological functions. It primarily consists of several key organs and structures:
                <ol>
                    <li><h3><span>Kidneys:</span></h3> The kidneys are bean-shaped organs located on either side of the spine, just below the ribcage. They are the central components of the excretory system. The main functions of the kidneys include filtering the blood to remove waste products, excess salts, and water to form urine. They also help regulate blood pressure.</li>
                    <li><h3><span>Ureters:</span></h3> Ureters: The ureters are narrow tubes that connect each kidney to the urinary bladder. They transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder.</li>
                    <li><h3><span>Urinary Bladder:</span></h3> The urinary bladder is a muscular sac that serves as a temporary storage reservoir for urine. It can expand to hold varying amounts of urine until it is expelled from the body.</li>
                    <li><h3><span>Urethra:</span></h3> The urethra is a tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.</li>

                The nervous system is a complex and vital system in the human body responsible for transmitting signals, processing information, and controlling various physiological functions. The parts of the nervous system are:
                <ol>
                    <li><h3><span>Brain:</span></h3> The brain is the central control center of the nervous system. It is responsible for processing sensory information, coordinating motor functions, and controlling conscious and subconscious processes. The brain is divided into different regions, each with specific functions, such as the cerebrum (responsible for thinking, memory, and conscious actions), cerebellum (controls coordination and balance), and brainstem (regulates basic functions like breathing and heart rate).</li>

                    <li><h3><span>Spinal Cord:</span></h3> The spinal cord is a long, tubular structure that extends from the base of the brain down through the spinal column. It serves as a communication pathway between the brain and the rest of the body. Sensory information is conveyed to the brain via the spinal cord, and motor commands are sent from the brain to the muscles and organs through the spinal cord.</li>

                    <li><h3><span>Nerves:</span></h3> Nerves are like cables that carry electrical impulses between your brain and the rest of your body. These impulses help you feel sensations and move your muscles. They also maintain certain autonomic functions like breathing, sweating or digesting food. Nerve cells are also called neurons.</li>
